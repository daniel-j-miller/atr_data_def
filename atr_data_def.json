Examples include stab and gunshot wounds, glass-related injuries and impalements. Examples include stab and gunshot wounds, bomb fragments, glass-related injuries and impalements. This excludes compound fractures where the bone breaks the skin, but includes compound fractures where an external object travels through the skin and into the bone. <br>Burn injuries are caused by exposure to electrical, thermal or corrosive agents such as flames, hot substances, chemicals or radiation. Examples include situations where electricity has primarily damaged soft tissues (electrical burns). <br>Other trauma includes hangings, near drowning and electrocution injuries. Examples include cases where electricity has resulted in more diffuse injuries involving other body systems (ie. electrocution) such as cardiac arrest, neurological injuries, fractures and compartment syndrome. <br>Not stated/inadequately described - type of injury cannot be determined. <br>In some cases, the dominant injury type will not be readily apparent. For example, a patient injured in a severe motor vehicle collision (which generally result in blunt injuries) may have additional penetrating injuries. When compared with blunt injuries sustained in such an injury event, such penetrating injuries may be minor (as in superficially embedded glass from a broken window) or major (as in impalement on an object within the vehicle). In such cases, the dominant injury type may be established by additional review of: <br>3.08 Injury event description; and <br>7.01 AIS Injury Codes <br>Where an injury event results in both blunt and non-blunt trauma of equal AIS severity, the non-blunt injury type should be used.
